# Frank 2.0 API – Privacy Policy

## Overview
Frank 2.0 does not store, track, or share any user data. This API is designed with sovereignty and personal autonomy in mind.

## Data Collection
- No personal data is collected or logged.
- No cookies or tracking technologies are used.
- Requests are processed in-memory and discarded after execution.

## Local Control
- If deployed locally, all operations occur entirely on the user’s machine.
- If hosted externally, server administrators are responsible for enforcing data minimization practices.

## Third-Party Sharing
- Frank 2.0 does **not** transmit data to third parties.
- There are no analytics, ad services, or surveillance scripts included.

## User Responsibility
Users are responsible for maintaining operational security when self-hosting this API.

## Updates
This policy may evolve as Frank 2.0 extends into public infrastructure. For now, this privacy stance is zero-retention, zero-tracking, sovereignty-aligned.
